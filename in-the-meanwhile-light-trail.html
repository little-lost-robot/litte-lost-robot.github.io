The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent economic crisis has seen a large number of shops in the city centre become empty; these vacated spaces are highly visible. In The Meanwhile, seeks to support the council to reinvigorate these spaces during this interim period. </p>

Working with a variety of clays and at different scales every piece is unique as the work continually evolves. For example the use of stains wedged into clay. The Rondo series incorporated LEDs within wall hung pieces enabled by  a collaboration with a fabricator. Construction techniques used include throwing on a potters wheel and handbuilding with white and coloured porcelain.</p>

The careful construction of temporarily used nests and temporality of ‘in the meanwhile’ spaces versus comfort and security links with ideas of displacement and the emptiness of now functionless nests and empty shop windows. Rooks are communal breeders so placing these nests in a community setting in a city centre highlights our complex relationship with the natural world.</p>

Artworks are constructed using natural materials and found objects which when transformed into sculptural forms are often ephemeral. The liminal space just above and just below the ground inspires me. The ordinary and often unnoticed surfaces under our feet are a continuing source of material.”</p>

Her work references the insignificant, disastrous and delightful aspects of life, placing them in conjunction, to explore how context changes meaning. These comparisons of travesty and triviality do not intend to judge, instead, they aim to question the prevalence of social construction and re-frame our perception of truth. Laurens work is layered with juxtaposition and satire, it jumps from sobriety to silliness to mobilise challenging topics and jolt its audience from the familiar to the unexpected.</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">My work is a reflection of writing, poems, observations in nature, human behaviour and dreams. A mixture of abstract and surreal approaches to materials and texture; I mostly work with paint and stained glass. Sculpture, photography and drawing are keen elements to my practice. I am a spontaneous maker; I allow the art to dictate the next step; lead itself to the final line. My way of making is experimental from beginning to end, which isn’t systematic, but open to speculations.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">About Us</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">We are a creative collaboration between Ruby Soho, Designer & Maker and Joseph Wilk, Digital artist.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="mb-0">A female, traveller artist brought up on a council estate and an artist who experiences disability due to chronic illness when he was a student. Neither has allowed themselves or their work to be compromised by negative social bias. Ruby is a keen advocate and activist for human rights, creating fairer opportunities for people limited by socio-economic factors. In particular invisible inequalities for ‘outsider’ communities. Joseph’s creative practice deals with the social model of disability, whereby disability is caused by the way society is organised, rather than by a person's impairment or difference. It looks at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for disabled.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="mb-0">We present a vision of the future that is gloriously humane in all its messy domestic parts with sensory, immersive and digital artwork, hybridising robotics and automation with humaneness and well-being.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="mb-0">The aim is to demystify emerging technologies and provide genuine public accessibility to playable urban spaces immediately. We demonstrate that harnessing this technology can allow us to influence our built environment in the near future. And thereby exist in a world that is more sensitive to our collective physical and mental well-being. This work can help influence forthcoming urban planning, by bringing visibility to the pressures on contemporary standards of living, from climate change and risks to societal, ethical and data privacy rights, that arise in the age of so -called ‘smart cities’.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="mb-0">We have a long-standing background in large scale, outdoor work and overarching intent to take inclusion to the heart of the design process. Our creative practice crosses the boundaries between research and real world scenarios that continually inform one another. Our intention is to adapt and evolve urban spaces for the forthcoming pedestrianisation of city spaces in the near future and the introduction of low emissions zones. We will do this by providing, responsive, playable, socially democratic spaces that allow visitors to explore an interactive story of their own influence.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="mb-0">We want to take the opportunity to help the reopening of public spaces with humane design and health and wellbeing at the core. Influencing our cities to be anti-polluting and clean breathing. The wider scope is innovating the way in which we discuss the interplay between people and new technologies, both in terms of physical spaces and in terms of wider digital community building.</p>
